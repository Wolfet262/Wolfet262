## User Stories
As someone who loves little gimmicks I want to be able to entertain my family for a short time in the evening.

As someone who values visuals, I want the page to be responsive and animations to be smooth. 

As a consumer I want the results to be displayed in a fun way that excites me when they return.

## Current unsolved problems:
When the results are displayed, if a result is a 7%,14%, or 28% the api adds on 7-8 0's with a 1 or 2 at the end, it does not do it with any other numbers that are known.

## Hurdles crossed to finish.
The single largest delay i had was getting the slidein animation to fire when the P tags were populated. I went through many iterations and ideas but what ended up working was to use the .forEach() higher order function to assign each element a new class that had all of that animations.
